BumbleBomber
===========

My entry for the bbgcomp2 challenge; 12 hours to cobble together a game in the style of _bullet-hell/space shooter (a la r-type)_

I made the game specifically for mobile devices (tested on Galaxy S2), but it will work in any modern browser.

I used the code from my whiskey game http://arcade.starfish.ie/whiskey as a starting point.
The code (for whiskey) was written over a year and quite a mess, but provided the kickstart I needed, given the incredibly tight 12hour time limit.
I spent about 10hours in total on BumbleBomber and while it's not masterpiece I'm happy with the result. Plans are afoot to convert it into a fully fledged game, so watch this space. 

The code is open source so feel free to learn from it, fork it and make it even better.
